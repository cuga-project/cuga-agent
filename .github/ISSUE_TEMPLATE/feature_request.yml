        Thanks for suggesting a new feature! Please provide detailed information to help us understand and evaluate your request.

  - type: textarea

    attributes:
      label: Feature Request
      description: A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see added.
      placeholder: |
        Example: Add support for exporting data in JSONL format.
    validations:
      required: true

    id: motivation
    attributes:
      label: Motivation / Problem
      description: What problem does this feature solve? What's the motivation behind this request?
      placeholder: |
        Example: Currently, the repo only supports CSV export. This makes it hard to train ML models directly, since most frameworks consume JSONL.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: use-case
    attributes:
      label: Use Case
      description: Describe your specific use case and how this feature would help you.
      placeholder: |
        Example: As a data scientist, I need to export millions of rows quickly into JSONL so I can stream them into PyTorch without heavy preprocessing. Right now, I have to export CSV, then convert it, which costs both time and compute.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed-solution
    attributes:
      label: Proposed Solution
      description: How would you like this feature to work? Describe your ideal implementation.
      placeholder: |
        Example: Add an optional `--format jsonl` flag to the export command.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: alternatives
    attributes:
      label: Alternatives Considered
      description: What alternatives have you considered? What workarounds are you currently using?
      placeholder: |
        Example: 
        - Export CSV and run a custom conversion script (current workaround)
        - Use SQLite export, but that requires external tooling
